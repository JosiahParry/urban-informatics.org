## Studying Covid-19's Effect on Community Vulnerability in Massachusetts

The Covid-19 crisis has exposed the weak hidden foundations upon which our ‘prosperous’ society was built, and exacerbated visible ones. The most visible of these factors is the sudden jump in unemployment over the summer. This project aims to develop a 'Community Vulnerability Index' to understand the devastating effects the health and economic crisis brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. It aims to identify communities in Massachusetts most affected by heightened unemployment during the summer for targeted relief and developmental assistance.
