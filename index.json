[{"categories":[],"contents":"Urban Informatics is a field of study based strictly on the urban environment and more specifically, cities. The urban environment is a very real and physical place. It is not some metaphysical conception that can only be spoken about in broad strokes. There are buildings, roads and intersections, land marks, restaurants and many other physical attributes that make up a city.\nThe city is a place. But when we refer to the city is a place, we are referring to some amorphous geographical boundary which has within it, more places. Boston is a city with clear physical boundaries on it\u0026rsquo;s Eastern and Northern sides\u0026mdash;the Atlantic and the Charles river\u0026mdash;though within it there are further places. There are neighborhoods like the South End and Back Bay which are also places with clearer and distinct boundaries. Within these there are further places like Blackstone Square and the Prudential Centers. These smaller places server a general interest. They can be referred to as land marks and are referenceable with a large degree of accuracy. These types of places are called places of interest.\nPlaces of interest, or POI, are locations that can be accurately located on the map which have some interest to the general public. POI have become increasingly important to the field of urban informatics with companies such as SafeGraph and Foursquare providing place based data. The data can be used to understand land use patterns, street networks, and so much more. Many people are using POI data extensively to understand the coronavirus pandemic (see SafeGraph research here).\nOne of the largest challenges to POI data is that of coverage. How many of the total POIs in a region are actually recorded in a database? How can we be certain that when using POI data that it is accurate? How do we best record changes to the environment when a POI, say restaurant, now longer exists?\nFrom my perspective, there seems to be no cohesive or theoretical definition of a place of interest other than \u0026ldquo;a place of interest.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the phrase is so simple that it does not need further clarification. But there are still some questions that I suspect need further elaboration. Most pressingly, and this may be a futile line of thought, what actually makes a POI interesting? Seemingly anything maybe a POI and is determined by those who generate or provide the data. The criteria seems that the data must 1) have a coordinate point and 2) be able to described as a place.\nThe Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI) collects Boston based POI data. Among the many data resources they provide are the locations of Boston Airbnbs as provided by Inside Airbnb. These data are used extensively within the Urban Informatics program.\nThe below map utilizes the Airbnb POI data to illustrate spatial distribution and price of Airbnb listings within Boston.\n ","permalink":"/blog/2021-04-26-understanding-places-of-interest/","tags":["POI"],"title":"Understanding Places of Interest"},{"categories":[],"contents":"https://rspatial.org/raster/analysis/3-spauto.html\nlibrary(sf) #\u0026gt; Linking to GEOS 3.8.1, GDAL 3.1.4, PROJ 6.3.1 queen_contiguity \u0026lt;- st_intersects(uitk::suffolk_county) #\u0026gt; although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar  #https://spatialanalysis.github.io/lab_tutorials/Contiguity_Spatial_Weights.html#queen-contiguity st_queen \u0026lt;- function(a, b = a) st_relate(a, b, pattern = \"F***T****\") st_queen(uitk::suffolk_county) #\u0026gt; although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_relate_pattern assumes that they are planar #\u0026gt; Sparse geometry binary predicate list of length 203, where the predicate was `relate_pattern' #\u0026gt; first 10 elements: #\u0026gt; 1: 2, 15, 168, 171, 172, 179, 180 #\u0026gt; 2: 1, 71, 180 #\u0026gt; 3: 45, 50, 92, 122 #\u0026gt; 4: 30, 84, 127, 135, 136, 138 #\u0026gt; 5: 34, 87, 100, 108 #\u0026gt; 6: 38, 93, 131, 142 #\u0026gt; 7: 8, 13, 60, 63, 88, 109, 141 #\u0026gt; 8: 7, 13, 66, 109, 141 #\u0026gt; 9: 15, 93 #\u0026gt; 10: 11, 79, 107, 186  ","permalink":"/blog/2021-05-07-spatial-autocorrelation-in-r/","tags":[],"title":"Spatial Autocorrelation in R"},{"categories":[],"contents":"A paper summary in 500ish words  \u0026ldquo;political conflict over LULUs is a struggle between capital and community via the intermediary of the state.\u0026rdquo;\n \n Cartoon by Luke McGarry \nIn order to understand the rising YIMBY movement, we need to first understand its progenitor, NIMBY. There is no better paper to start at than \u0026ldquo;Rethinking NIMBY\u0026rdquo; by Robert W. Lake (1993). In this paper Lake introduces us to the common conception of NIMBY, his nuanced view of NIMBY in relation to capitalism, and the necessary political process which creates the NIMBY movement. The paper may be more aptly titled \u0026ldquo;In Defense of NIMBY.\u0026rdquo;\nNIMBY, or Not In My Back Yard, is an opposition movement to unwanted development of locally unwanted land uses (LULU). LULUs are places like landfills, roads, recovery centers and the like which have some societal benefit. NIMBY is often thought to be \u0026ldquo;selfish\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;parochial\u0026rdquo; given these proposed developments serve some good\u0026mdash;we all need roads, right? NIMBY has been a surprising success in thwarting developments in favor of \u0026ldquo;neighborhood ambiance.\u0026rdquo;\nLake challenges general antipathy towards NIMBY by addressing a problematic understanding of LULUs. Those who oppose NIMBY make the assumption that LULUs provide a societal good. But what Lake points out is that they are a \u0026ldquo;particular solution to a problem.\u0026rdquo; Acceptance of LULUs accepts the status quo and assumes that there couldn\u0026rsquo;t be a better solution to the problem.\nLake then points out that NIMBY is actually an inevitability and a sign of successful developments. Think of development like creating a product to sell. You need to have customers. In order to produce the product, you need investors who believe there will be profit. The same is true with development. Private investors build to a target consumer base to ensure future profit. Then people move in or start utilizing the developments creating a land use pattern. The development\u0026mdash;say multifamily homes with local markets and cafés\u0026mdash;will develop their own problems such as \u0026ldquo;low-density development, suburban sprawl, [and] inadequate services.\u0026rdquo;\nWe come to two challenges: 1) current consumers of the existing land use want to maintain the status quo. And 2) changes to the land use would be beneficial to investors to increase their profitability. Proposed changes to the land use are likely against NIMBY best interest but are in the best interest of private industry.\nThe propositions by private industry are not always in the interest of the existing neighborhood or in the best interest of society. Lake provides the example of hazardous waste incinerators. Hazardous waste is that, hazardous. Over a span of 15 years NIMBY collective action prevented a single incinerator from being built. Through this example we see that NIMBY can be an effective movement in challenging existing social structures.\nThus, we come to the conclusion that \u0026ldquo;local community perspective is not necessarily opposed to the societal good\u0026mdash;but nor is it necessarily synonymous with it.\u0026rdquo; Or more simply, the NIMBY movement can be helpful in challenging private industry and government to address the underlying issues that LULUs are meant to address.\n Glossary x1 x 2\n NIMBY: not in my back yard YIMBY: yes, in my back yard  sub-list   Zoning Land use pattern \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;    NIMBY: not in my backyard \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n YIMBY: yes, in my backyard \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"/blog/2021-04-25-rethinking-nimby/","tags":[],"title":"Rethinking NIMBY"},{"categories":[],"contents":"The urban data collective (name under construction) was borne out of a desire to create an easy and non-academic resource for the field of urban informatics.
