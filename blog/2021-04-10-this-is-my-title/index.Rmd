I think whatever I type here will show up in the preview of the blog post.

### Some random header

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() 
```

```{r}
library(uitk)
```

Now if i add some words here what is the spacing? 

Okay it looks pretty good. But I am concerned about headings.

```{r}
ggplot(acs_edu, aes(x = bach, y = med_house_income, color = white)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs(x = "% of population with a Bachelor's Degree",
       y = "Median Household Income",
       title = "Relationship between Education and Income",
       subtitle = "Colored by whiteness") 
```



```{r}
hist(rnorm(1000))
```

```{r}
plot(rnorm(500), runif(500)) 
```
